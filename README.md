This is project that I am developing for code of Louisville program which is due in November.

The website is called "Always Grooming". The viewable sizes are tablet and desktop. It is a basic website that is built for small, private grooming salon employers and employees to help them with daily work-related stuff. As technology is evolving, so is small business shops that are still transiting from paper files to electronic files. It is not fancy or filled with pretty stuff as groomers/stylists are usually busy as they take in client's order/request and work.
